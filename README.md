# 100-days-of-code

It's a 100-day challenge to make a habit of coding everyday and develop my skill sets, because [Alexander Kallaway](https://github.com/Kallaway)'s #100DaysOfCode challenge inspired me. More details about the challenge can be found here: [100daysofcode.com](http://100daysofcode.com/) or [the official repo](https://github.com/Kallaway/100-days-of-code).

## **Main target:**

- I will code for at least 2 hours every day for the next 100 days.
- I will strive to be better today than I was yesterday.
