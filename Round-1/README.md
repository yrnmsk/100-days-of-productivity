### **Status**

- I failed this challenge. My progress has been slow and admittingly disappointing for it was fluctuating and inconsistent.
- Starting at the early days (days 1 to 10), those were the days were my learning and progress skyrocketed and seemingly unstoppable.
- As days passed, my motivation seemingly went down as I got distracted a lot more often because my momentum was disrupted by our sudden going out of town without my personal laptop with me.
- At the end, by day 25, a tragedy struck, and so we didn't have any internet connection to which my progress naturally halted.
- Decided to redo the challenge, and here we are. Round 2 can be found [here](../Round-2/README.md).
