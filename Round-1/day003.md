### Thoughts:

- I know in myself I could've been a lot more productive than I did today, so I'm a bit disappointed.
- I fixed (at least I think so) my sleep schedule and my eating schedule today, yay. I think I slept about 12am last night, and then woke up from time to time as I slept when it was dawn, and finally woke up about 6am.
- Though I fixed (again, at least I think so) my sleeping schedule, I was still out of it and wasn't in my form. I couldn't adapt that fast so I was not that productive. Add the fact that day time tends to be generally full of distraction and other noise, so it's hard to stay in focus and do what I have to do.
- I hope tomorrow gets a lot better.
