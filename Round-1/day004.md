### Today's Progress:

- freeCodeCamp(ES6): JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
- 100-days-of-code: round 1
  - readme: update goals
  - day: fix day 3 typo
  - day: add day 4
- Erutidians(trello): update goals

### Thoughts:

- most unproductive day yet.
- started the day pretty bad. slept a bit late last night due to personal reasons (self-reflections and such) at about 2am so i woke up at about 10am. by then it just got downhill. i ate small breakfast and after eating i somehow managed to fall asleep again after lying on bed while im on the phone, so i woke up again by 3:30pm.
- hope this never happens again.
- i will force myself to sleep later by 10pm sharp, no matter what, so i can start the next day pretty nice with my preferred time which is about 4am.
