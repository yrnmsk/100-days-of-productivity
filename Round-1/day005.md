### Today's Progress:

- freeCodeCamp: JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures
  - topic: Regular Expressions
  - topic: Debugging
  - topic: Basic Data Structures (finished half: 10/20)

### Notes:

- a bit productive today, despite of a rough start. woke up really really early (~3am), even before my alarm (4am), but I just spent about 2hrs of it to personal time (reading manga, watching yt, etcetc)
- finished two topics in fcc, tho I only half-finished basic data structures as we had to go out.

### Thoughts:

- today was a bit rainy and even had a lot of personal time which was a bit rare since I started this challenge, so I'm a bit grateful.
- a bit stupid, I slept about 10mins after 8am, I ate some small breakfast and when I got back, I somehow went straight to bed. and when someone woke me up since I didn't know we were going out, so I thought that we'd go home the same day later but we actually were going to Cavite to settle some family business matters as well as each other's personal matters, that's why I forgot my lappy at Laguna. this may backfire and make me skip a day or two of this challenge, so this sucks.
