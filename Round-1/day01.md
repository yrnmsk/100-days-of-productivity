### Today's Progress:

- initialized repositories: [100-days-of-code](https://github.com/yrnmsk/100-days-of-code) & [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/yrnmsk/freeCodeCamp)
- freeCodeCamp(BootStrap): Front End Development Libraries

### Notes:

- a bit unproductive, woke up really really late (about 6pm, I slept about 5am)
- I still have to somehow fix my sleeping schedule as well as my eating schedule.

### Thoughts:

- started [100-days-of-code](https://github.com/plskx/100-days-of-code) today. wish to have a great journey
- also started freeCodeCamp along with 100-days-of-code today, hope I learn a lot.
