[<< Day 17](day017.md) | [Day 19 >>](day019.md)

### Today's Progress:

- TheOdinProject(foundations): about 43% progress
  - project: [odin recipes](https://github.com/yrnmsk/odin-recipes)
- 100DoC: round 1
  - update goals & projects completed
  - add & update day 18

### Thoughts:

- really really delved and absorbed what I can about the topics from TheOdinProject apart from what I already knew and already practiced/memorized.
- also explored more about the topics that I thought I already know which really reassessed the depth of my knowledge, especially in terms of terminal commands, how the internet really works, and etcetc.
