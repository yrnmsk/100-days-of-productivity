### Today's Progress:

- TheOdinProject(foundations): about 60% progress
  - started new repo [landing page](https://github.com/yrnmsk/odin-landing-page)
  - tried a shitty draft implementation for the [landing page](https://github.com/yrnmsk/odin-landing-page/commit/4665e18236541bb03881fd3bd2dc8e3820226185)

### Thoughts:

- my level of motivation hopefully could be improved. webdev almost always makes me feel bored and feel like i'm not doing anything important/relevant which in turn makes me hate what i do. i love designing in general, but for some reason, webdev just doesnt click with me or something.

### Resources:

- TheOdinProject: additional resources and assignments
  - [the box model](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Building_blocks/The_box_model)
