### Today's Progress:

- TheOdinProject: draft small progress (uncommitted and not pushed)

### Thoughts:

- didn't really progress that much on the landing page. always hated my implementation so i always restart from scratch.
- level of motivation only worsened when it comes to the css part. didnt improve nor learned anything worth mentioning.
- also had severe migraine during the half of the day. it was not good and my head ached so much.
