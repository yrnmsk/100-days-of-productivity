### Today's Progress:

- TheOdinProject: finish landing page
- 100DoC: add missed day 23 and add day 24

### Notes:

- finally finished the landing page. was really stalling and really unmotivating to finish this for the past few days.
- couldve finished this last night, but i kinda strayed and got really distracted and so was just unproductive yet again, watching twitch streams.

### Thoughts:

- today's progress was mostly just forced. couldnt really take it anymore with how unproductive ive been for the past few days so i just toughed it up and finally finished the landing page project from TheOdinProject.
- writing this 100DoC about 12pm, i havent slept yet, and so will just take a lunch and then prolly hit the sack and pass out.
- a bit excited and slightly motivated for when i wake up since i progressed and finally got out of the css part in TOP, and so will be taking the next part which is about javascript. hopefully my knowledge further deepens about the things i think i already know.
- also hope i pick up, if possible, some good practices and what not.
