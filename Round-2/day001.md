### Today's Progress:

- started working on [@erutidians/auto-dop](https://github.com/erutidians/auto-dop)'s readme with [@plskz](https://github.com/plskz)

### Thoughts:

- learned about the existence of github codespaces. tried to use it and found that it was really useful.
- super rusty getting back after almost over a week of without internet and real access to dev stuffs.

### Resources:

- explored [this](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces) documentation about codespaces.
- delved a bit deeper about [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io) and terminal aliases in general
