### Today's Progress:

- progressed a lot in guitar. i can now do complex chord progressions ive been practicing after composing it from scratch just 3 days ago which i can do in one take almost perfectly today.
- reviewed and approved [@plskz](https://github.com/plskz)'s [PR](https://github.com/erutidians/100-days-of-productivity/pull/1) which was from yesterday.
- started doing the readme for [@erutidians/auto-dop](https://github.com/Erutidians/auto-dop/blob/main/README.md)

### Notes:

- was really chill this day, it was rainy and very vibey and moody, so not that a lot of progress in terms of dev stuffs during the first half of the day.
- 

### Thoughts:

- couldve probably pushed myself a lot more, if only it wasnt hard to resist my 'rainy debuff' where im urged to just take everything easy lmao
