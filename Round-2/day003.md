### Today's Progress:

- released [auto-dop](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@erutidians/auto-dop), a utility npm package for 100dop repositories we (with @pslkz) made
- 100-days-of-productivity:
  - renamed 100-days-of-code private repo into 100-days-of-productivity public repo
  - fixed most of the lingering issues from renaming and changing visibility all thoughout the repo
  - added home buttons for round readme's
  - added use of utility [auto-dop](https://github.com/erutidians/auto-dop) to repo
  - cleaned most of readme's and other markdowns
  - updated undocumented days

### Notes:

- despite spending most of my time during the first half of the day in bed because of the rain, i was still really productive and feel like i made up for it.
- mood and vibes be vibey, productivity go brrr.
- also couldve documented a lot more, but meh, this is fine
