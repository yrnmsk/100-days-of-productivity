### Today's Progress:

- practiced guitar for almost the whole day when we were on the lake until my hand and fingers hurt like hell.

### Notes:

- i wish i brought the ukulele too, coulda practiced ukulele a lot too since ukulele is a bit easier and a lot gentler to use than the guitar.

### Thoughts:

- went out almost the whole day; celebrated with my family.
- we went fishing on a lake, and caught none lmao.
