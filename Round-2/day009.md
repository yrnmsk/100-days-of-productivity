[<< Day 8](day008.md) | [Day 10 >>](day010.md)

### Today's Progress:

- updated missed days for my 100dop.
- progressed a lot on guitar today too. im getting used to using a capo, and its sounding quite nicely too, noice.
- auto-dop:
  - started working on a new branch that fixes [#5](https://github.com/erutidians/auto-dop/issues/5)
  - also started working on a new branch [#7](https://github.com/erutidians/auto-dop/pull/7) about a missing sample index.js file
  - same with a new branch [#8](https://github.com/erutidians/auto-dop/pull/8) about a new feature called custom date

### Notes:

- we suddenly went fishing about 4pm and got home at about 7pm. woulda finished a lot more today, but family time is family time <img src='https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/6144a00a42092e37fb1be9b0/1x'>
- although i finished some of these branches a lot early than until their corresponding pr has been made, i expected that there would be merge conflicts so we decided to just do them synchronously.

### Thoughts:

- a bit tragic that i missed some days again for my 100 days of productivity, but meh, this is fine <img src='https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5e2914861df9195f1a4cd411/1x'>
- i feel like it is a bit forgiveable, since, well, it was my birthday. except for my almost 0 balance/money, i think everything is fine.
